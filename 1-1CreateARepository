1. Create an empty repository on github.com
2. On your machine, move to the folder that contains all your repositories (or create one), suppose "myRepos".
3. run command
	git clone https://github.com/username/repositoryname
4. You will observe that a folder, named as the repository name, is created in myRepos.
5. Move to this folder. 

Now you can make changes in this folder (your working directory) and can sync it with that hosted on remote server (github here).
