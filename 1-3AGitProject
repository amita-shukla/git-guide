A git project has three parts:

A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files.
	make changes to files:
	+ additions
	- deletions
	M modifications
A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory.
A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project.
