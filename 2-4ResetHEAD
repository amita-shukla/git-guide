"Unstage added file"
The files you've added to the staging area belong in the same commit.

We can unstage that file from the staging area using

						git reset HEAD filename

This command resets the file in the staging area to be the same as the HEAD commit. 
It does not discard file changes from the working directory, 
it just removes them from the staging area.
