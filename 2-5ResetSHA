"rewind the project's history"

If you want to revert back to an older commit, use
					git reset SHA
This command works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit. 

For example, if the SHA of the previous commit is 
5d692065cf51a2f50ea8e7b19b5a7ae512f633ba, use:

					git reset 5d69206
					
1. print out your Git commit log.
Note: If your cursor gets stuck in "git log" mode in the terminal, 
press "q" on your keyboard to escape.

2.Enter the command to reset to a previous commit, 
using the first 7 characters of one of the past commit SHAs in your Git log.

Next, print the Git commit log again.

Notice anything interesting? 
The commits that came after the one you reset to are gone. 
The HEAD commit has been reassigned. 
YOU JUST CHANGED HISTORY!!!
