Up to this point, you've worked in a single Git branch called master. 
Git allows us to create branches to experiment with versions of a project. 
Imagine you want to create version of a story with a happy ending. 
You can create a new branch and make the happy ending changes to that branch only. 
It will have no effect on the master branch until you're ready to merge the happy ending to the master branch.

To know your current branch, use
			git branch
In the output, the * (asterisk) shows you what branch youâ€™re on.
