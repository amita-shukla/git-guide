New Branch is a different version of the Git project. 
It contains commits from Master but also has commits that Master does not have.

To create a new branch, use:

			git branch new_branch
			
Be sure to name your branch something that describes the purpose of the branch. 
Also, branch names canâ€™t contain whitespaces: 
new-branch and new_branch are valid branch names, but new branch is not.
