To include all the changes made to the new branch on the master branch.
We can easily accomplish this by merging the branch into master with:
Change to master branch first:
		
		git checkout master
then,
		git merge branch_name
		
If the new branch contained the most recent commit, it is said that the merge is a 
"fast forward".
