Git offers a variety of collaboration tools, that make it easy for us to collaborate among team members
working under a project.

For two people sitting apart to collaborate on a project, we need:
1. A complete replica of the project on our local computers.
2. A way to keep track and review each other's work.
3. Access to a definitive project version.

For all the above, we use 'remotes'.

What is a remote?

A remote is a shared git repository that allows multiple collaborators to work on the same git project
sitting at different locations.
Collaborators work on the project independently, and merge changes together when they are ready to do so.


A remote is a Git repository that lives outside your Git project folder. 
Remotes can live on the web, on a shared network or even in a separate folder on your local computer.
