To get your own replica of the project on your local machine,
we use the command
				git clone remote-location clone_name
				
here 'remote-location' is the path to the remote repo.
It can be a web address or any path in the computer.

'clone_name' this is the name of the directory in which the remote repo is cloned.

If you just write the command
			git clone remote-location

you get a folder named as the name of the remote repo.
