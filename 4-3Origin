When we clone a repository, the git gives the remote address the name 'origin'. 
this name is given for easier reference.

To list the remotes of a git repository, use the command:
				git remote -v

The output:
origin	https://github.com/amita-shukla/git-guide (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/amita-shukla/git-guide (push)
