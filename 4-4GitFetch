You local clone may not remain up to date as multiple collaborators contribute to the project.
An easy way to see if changes have been made to the remote and bring the changes down to your
local copy is with the following command:
					git fetch

This command will not merge changes from the remote into your local repository. 
It brings those changes onto what's called a remote branch. 

Make a note of the output of the command
					git show HEAD

After running this command, though changes have been fetched to the local copy of the git project,
Your local master branch does NOT get updated with these changes. The commits have actually been fetched
to origin/master branch. Your local branch has not been updated.

So we cannot view or make changes to any of the work that has been added to the remote repo.

We use the command:
					git merge origin/master
			
This uses the 'git merge' command to integrate origin/master branch to local master branch.

Run 
					git show HEAD
again. If there have been changes in the remote, we can observe these changes now after merging.
The HEAD commit is changed to the latest one done by some other collaborators.
