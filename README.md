# git-guide

The repository contains steps to be taken to work with git effortlessly.
In formal terms, git is a "version control system".
 Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
Git allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. 
And it helps the team cope with the confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.
